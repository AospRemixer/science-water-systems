Water is then distributed to homes and businesses in large pipes called water mains that are usually buried under our roads and sidewalks. Water pumping facilities and water mains are maintained by the City, and paid for by water rates. That's the way you think water system's work. That is all true but, there are sme things we miss through the way. The pipes used to made in lead. Which caused it to mix in with the water. Some people drink that water. Theses pipes are what cause so many bad things to happen. People get something called e-coli because of this! Our rivers and lakes situated north of 60 degrees latitude constitute some of Canada's largest water bodies. The Mackenzie River, for example, is over 4000 kilometres long and is the country's largest river. Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories, is the world's ninth largest lake (by area).</p>

            <hr class="light my-4">
            <p class="text-faded mb-4"><strong>1.</strong> Provides Nourishment

Water is life. The sooner those in power understand this, the sooner this law of water being available to everyone can be implemented. Water is the number one source of nutrition.  The human body is made of 60% water, and this is a clear enough indication of the importance of water. Humans need to be adequately hydrated for their physiological systems to function. Additionally, water helps maintain organ health and allows the blood to maintain the consistency it requires to flow freely and transport oxygen and nutrients to every cell of the body.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2.</strong> The Prevention of Diseases

Did you know that if people are unable to drink safe and clean water, it gives rise to various kinds of diseases? Fatal medical conditions like cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis A all occur because of the consumption and or the presence of contaminated water. Imagine the risks that people are exposed to when the only thing they can drink is water that comes from sewage and contaminated sites like industries. Clean water is essential not only to remain safe from disease but also to maintain good health.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Helps in Getting Rid of Toxins

Clean, fresh and safe water also helps in getting the body rid of all kinds of toxins, whether they are created due to bodily reactions, obtained from outside sources or ones that occur because of the consumption of contaminated water.
<br>
<br>
<strong>4.</strong> Needed for Agriculture and Food Production

When it comes to the production of food, clean water is an essential ingredient. If the crops and grains are given contaminated water, the bacteria and disease will spread to those who consume the fresh produce. Therefore, water that is used for agriculture must also come from safe and clean resources.
<br>
<br>
<strong>5.</strong> Improved Sanitation Facilities

Clean water is not just needed for drinking but for sanitation purposes as well. If clothes are washed, or the body is washed with contaminated water, this too will result in the rise of diseases. Same is the case for cooking, cleaning and other similar tasks that are an integral part of our lives. Clean water is necessary for good health.  </p>

So <strong>what would happen if we didn't have clean water?</strong> Your body can become permanently stunted and damaged.

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Most people living in Canada have access to safe water. ... As of December 31, there were six “boil-water advisories” and three “do not consume advisories” affecting eight First Nations Indigenous communities in British Columbia. The lack of binding water quality regulations coupled with erratic funding, insufficient infrastructure and degraded water sources have led to systemic problems with drinking water on reserves. The federal government holds the purse strings for water systems on reserves. Canadian governments have spent many years and billions of dollars trying to make clean water flow from the taps on First Nations. At any given time, some 100 First Nations are under water advisories, according to non-profit organization The Council of Canadians. So its mostly the First Nations that are in the north, and some places in British Columbia.</p>

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">How does water get from water source to your house? First we need to figure out where the water source is? As far as where all the water is from that we use in our homes, it is from either a groundwater source, such as a well, or from a surface-water source, such a river, lake, or reservoir. So the water gets pumped through pipes! For old houses the water comes through zinc pipes which waso very harmful. Newer houses are using a safer matireal the won't mess with the water that your are drinking. Some people have added a filter to the places where you get water from to keep extra safety. Now if you have a old house without a filter, then you will recive the dirty water filled with gross bacteria. Don't drink this type of water. This type of water is the type of water that can cause e coli! If you have a old house with a filter then obviously drink it. Just make sure your filter is good :) If you have a newer house then you have nothing to worry about!</p>

Water used by homeowners, businesses, schools and industry is processed by the City of London's wastewater treatment system before it is returned to the Thames River 
A networt of pipes leads wastewater from homes and businesses to a pumping station and then to one of London's six Pollution Control Plants (PCPs) At the PcP, a six-step process removes gartage, organic solids and bacteria. Clean water is returned to the Thames River and waste byproducts are incinerated. Each step is carefuly monitored by staff with the help of a state-of-the-art computer system. </p>

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Adults exposed to lead can suffer from: Cardiovascular effects, increased blood pressure and incidence of hypertension. Decreased kidney function. Reproductive problems (in both men and women). The lead that is released from galvanized pipes can pose significant health concerns when it makes its way into a household's drinking water. Ingesting too much lead can result in lead poisoning, which causes a wide range of symptoms and complications including: Fatigue. Headaches. E coli and any common virus like Covid-19 can come with the water if the pipes are made with bad material like lead! Lead dissolving into drinking water from lead pipes can be harmful if it builds up in the body – especially for babies and children, whose development can be affected. The use of lead in plumbing has been banned in the UK for more than 25 years, and houses built before 1970 are most likely to have lead pipes.

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Our water resources face a host of serious threats, all of which are caused primarily by human activity. They include sedimentation, pollution, climate change, deforestation, landscape changes, and urban growth.
            One of the most serious threats to water resources is the degradation of ecosystems, which often takes place through changes to landscapes such as the clearance of forests, the conversion of natural landscapes to farmland, the growth of cities, the building of roads, and surface mining. Each type of change to a landscape will have its own specific impact, usually directly on natural ecosystems and directly or indirectly on water resources.</p>
