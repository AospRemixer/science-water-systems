            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Water is withdrawn from the water source and pumped to our homes and businesses. Water is then distributed to homes and businesses in large pipes called water mains that are usually buried under our roads and sidewalks. Water pumping facilities and water mains are maintained by the City, and paid for by water rates. That's the way you think water system's work. That is all true but, there are sme things we miss through the way. The pipes used to made in lead. Which caused it to mix in with the water. Some people drink that water. Theses pipes are what cause so many bad things to happen. People get something called e-coli because of this!</p>

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Why should we worry about this? If thats what you think, then I think you should <strong>GET SOME HELP</strong> because who will be okay with drinking dirty water that touches gross things while its traveling to your house? You can't be sure what your drinking! What if your drinking some bacteria that has been in dirty places? Our body is 60% water, and you don't care about it. This is some seroius thing that you should be cautious about. Be thankful that you have this knowledge, and take some action to solve this problem!</p>

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">How does water get from water source to your house? First we need to figure out where the water source is? As far as where all the water is from that we use in our homes, it is from either a groundwater source, such as a well, or from a surface-water source, such a river, lake, or reservoir. So the water gets pumped trhough pipes! For old houses the waater comes through zinc pipes which waso very harmful. Newer houses are using a safer matireal the won't mess with the water that your are drinking. Some people have added a filter to the places where you get water from to keep extra safety. Now if you have a old house without a filter, then you will recive the dirty water filled with gross bacteria. Don't drink this type of water. This type of water is the type of water that can cause e coli! If you have a old house with a filter then obviously drink it. Just make sure your filter is good :) If you have a newer house then you have nothing to worry about!</p>

            <p class="text-faded mb-4">Adults exposed to lead can suffer from: Cardiovascular effects, increased blood pressure and incidence of hypertension. Decreased kidney function. Reproductive problems (in both men and women). The lead that is released from galvanized pipes can pose significant health concerns when it makes its way into a household's drinking water. Ingesting too much lead can result in lead poisoning, which causes a wide range of symptoms and complications including: Fatigue. Headaches. E coli and any common virus like Covid-19 can come with the water if the pipes are made with bad material like lead! Lead dissolving into drinking water from lead pipes can be harmful if it builds up in the body – especially for babies and children, whose development can be affected. The use of lead in plumbing has been banned in the UK for more than 25 years, and houses built before 1970 are most likely to have lead pipes.
